Interface for easily defining additional JavaScript (inline and/or by URL) to be added to all administration pages.


== Description ==

Ever want to introduce custom dynamic functionality to your WordPress admin pages and otherwise harness the power of JavaScript?  Any modification you may want to do with JavaScript can be facilitated via this plugin.

Using this plugin you'll easily be able to define additional JavaScript (inline and/or by URL) to be added to all administration pages. You can define JavaScript to appear inline in the admin head, admin footer (recommended), or in the admin footer within a jQuery `jQuery(document).ready(function($)) {}` section, or reference JavaScript files to be linked in the page header. The referenced JavaScript files will appear in the admin head first, listed in the order defined in the plugin's settings. Then any inline admin head JavaScript is added to the admin head. All values can be filtered for advanced customization (see Filters section).

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `add-admin-javascript.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. Go to "Appearance" -> "Admin JavaScript" and add some JavaScript to be added into all admin pages.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add JavaScript I defined via a file, or one that is hosted elsewhere? =

Yes, via the "Admin JavaScript Files" input field on the plugin's settings page.

= Can I limit what admin pages the JavaScript gets output on? =

No, not presently. At least not directly. By default, the JavaScript is added to every admin page on the site.

However, you can preface your selectors with admin page specific class(es) on 'body' tag to ensure CSS only applies on certain admin pages. (e.g. `jQuery('body.index-php h2').hide();`).

Or, you can hook all the plugin's filters and determine the current admin page content to decide whether the respective hook argument should be returned (and thus output) or not.

= Can I limit what users the JavaScript applies to? =

No, not presently. At least not directly. By default, the JavaScript is added for any user that can enter the admin section of the site.

You can hook all the plugin's filters and determine the current user to decide whether the respective hook argument should be returned (and thus output) for the user or not.

= Does this plugin include unit tests? =

Yes.


== Screenshots ==

The plugin exposes four filters for hooking. Typically, these customizations would be put into your active theme's functions.php file, or used by another plugin.
